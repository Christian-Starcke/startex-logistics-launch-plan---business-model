## 🧠 Key Insight (Important for StarTex Thinking)

Small brokerages = **1 person does all roles**  
Large brokerages = **assembly line specialization**

Why?

Because freight brokerage is really:

> **A transaction factory, not just sales.**

Scale comes from:

- specialization  
- speed  
- repetition  
- risk control
