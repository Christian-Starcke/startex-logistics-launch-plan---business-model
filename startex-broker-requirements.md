## Required Legal – Authorities & Registrations

### Legal Entity
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ LLC: Starcke Industries LLC (Texas)
- ✅ EIN obtained
- ⚠️ **PENDING:** Register DBA "StarTex Logistics" ($25-$50)

### FMCSA Registrations & Required Bonds
**Status:** ⚠️ **PENDING**

1. **MC Number** - $300 one-time
   - File OP-1 form via FMCSA URS
   - Processing: 20-25 business days
   - This is your operating authority as a broker
   - **Note:** DOT numbers are for motor carriers (companies that own/operate trucks). Brokers do NOT need DOT numbers.

2. **BOC-3 Filing** - $30-$50 one-time
   - Designate process agents (TX & NC minimum)
   - Required before MC approval

3. **UCR Registration** - $40-$50/year
   - Register in Texas (home state)
   - Renew annually before December 31

4. **Surety Bond** (MANDATORY)
   - **Amount:** $75,000 (BMC-84)
   - **Cost:** $1,000-$3,000/year
   - **Purpose:** Protects shippers/carriers from broker non-payment
   - **Note:** Cannot operate without this

### ⚠️ Critical Finding: Hazmat Requirements

**Brokers do NOT need hazmat certifications.** Standard broker authority covers both hazmat and non-hazmat freight.

- ✅ **Broker (StarTex):** No hazmat certifications needed - standard authority sufficient
- ✅ **Shipper (Chemical Manufacturers):** Responsible for hazmat classification/packaging
- ✅ **Carrier:** Must have hazmat endorsements for hazmat loads
- ⚠️ **Broker Responsibility:** Verify carrier hazmat credentials before accepting hazmat loads

**Impact:** Can serve full chemical manufacturer shipping needs (hazmat + non-hazmat) with same broker authority.

### Ongoing Compliance (Broker Responsibilities)

**Carrier Verification (REQUIRED)**
Before booking any load, verify:
- ✅ Active MC/DOT authority
- ✅ Minimum $1M cargo insurance
- ✅ Safety ratings (via SAFER)
- ✅ Hazmat endorsements (if hazmat freight)

**Record Keeping (FMCSA Requirement)**
Maintain for minimum 3 years:
- Rate confirmations
- Carrier contracts
- Carrier insurance certificates
- Transaction records
- Financial records

**Annual Renewals**
- Surety bond (continuous)
- Insurance policies
- UCR registration
- MC Authority: No renewal (permanent)

## Insurance Requirements (What 325110 Companies Will Expect)

**Target Market Context:** Chemical manufacturers (NAICS 325110) in the $50M-$250M revenue range are mid-to-large size companies with established risk management programs. They require higher insurance limits and more stringent verification than smaller manufacturers.

### 1. General Liability Insurance (REQUIRED)
- **Coverage Required:** $2M-$3M per occurrence / $4M-$5M aggregate
  - $50M-$250M revenue companies typically require $2M-$3M (not $1M)
  - Some may require $3M-$5M for high-value operations
- **Cost:** $1,200-$2,500/year (higher than smaller companies due to coverage limits)
- **Purpose:** Covers property damage and injuries during loading/unloading at chemical facilities
- **Status:** **Standard requirement from mid-to-large chemical manufacturers** - they will verify before contracting

### 2. Contingent Auto Liability Insurance (REQUIRED)
- **Coverage Required:** $1M minimum (most $50M-$250M companies require $1M, not $750K)
  - Even though you don't own trucks, mid-to-large chemical manufacturers require this
- **Cost:** $2,500-$5,000/year (contingent/non-owned auto liability)
- **Purpose:** Protects broker if carrier's auto liability is insufficient
- **Status:** **Non-negotiable requirement** - $50M-$250M revenue chemical manufacturers won't work with brokers without this

### 3. Contingent Cargo Insurance (REQUIRED)
- **Coverage Required:** $500K-$1M per shipment (mid-to-large chemical manufacturers typically require $500K-$1M, not $250K)
  - Higher cargo values in this revenue band justify higher limits
  - Some may require $1M-$2M per shipment for high-value chemical freight
- **Cost:** 
  - Non-hazmat: $2,500-$4,500/year
  - Hazmat: $4,500-$10,000+/year
- **Purpose:** Protects broker if carrier's cargo insurance fails or is insufficient
- **Status:** **Required by all $50M-$250M revenue chemical manufacturers** - they will request proof of coverage and verify limits before contracting

### 4. Errors & Omissions (E&O) Insurance
- **Coverage:** $500K-$1M (if purchased)
- **Cost:** $500-$1,500/year
- **Status:** **OPTIONAL** - Not required by chemical manufacturers or FMCSA
- **Purpose:** Protects broker from claims of professional mistakes (rate errors, documentation errors, negligence)
- **Note:** Chemical manufacturers focus on liability and cargo coverage, not professional liability. E&O is for your own risk management, not a shipper requirement.

### Validated Requirements Summary

**Based on industry research, chemical manufacturers (NAICS 325110) in the $50M-$250M revenue range typically require brokers to provide:**

1. **General Liability:** $2M-$3M per occurrence / $4M-$5M aggregate - **REQUIRED**
   - Higher than smaller manufacturers ($1M-$2M)
   - Some may require $3M-$5M for high-value operations

2. **Contingent Auto Liability:** $1M minimum (not $750K) - **REQUIRED**
   - Mid-to-large companies require $1M, not the lower $750K minimum
   - Non-negotiable requirement

3. **Contingent Cargo:** $500K-$1M per shipment (not $250K-$500K) - **REQUIRED**
   - Higher cargo values in this revenue band justify higher limits
   - Some may require $1M-$2M per shipment for high-value chemical freight

**NOT Required by Chemical Manufacturers:**
- ❌ **E&O Insurance** - Not typically required (optional for your own protection)
- ❌ **Workers' Compensation** - Not required for brokers (only for carriers/shippers with employees)

**Key Finding:** $50M-$250M revenue chemical manufacturers require **higher insurance limits** than smaller companies. Budget $7,200-$15,000+/year for insurance (vs $5,000-$8,000 for smaller manufacturers). They will verify coverage limits before contracting.
